BadRequest:
  description: |
    The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed 
    syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without 
    modifications.

NotFound:
  description: |
    Server has not found a resource with that URI. This may be 
    temporary and permanent condition. This status code is 
    commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal 
    exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other 
    response is applicable.

TooManyRequests:
  description: |
    When a server is under attack or just receiving a very 
    large number of requests from a single party, responding 
    to each with a 429 status code will consume resources. 
    Therefore, servers may drop connections or take other steps
    instead of responding with the 429 status code, when limiting
    resource usage.

InternalServerError:
  description: |
    Server encountered an error processing request. This should not 
    happen normally, but it is a generic error message, given when 
    no more specific message is suitable.

ServiceUnavailable:
  description: |
    temporary maintenance of service, try again later. The implication 
    is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated 
    after some delay. If known, the length of the delay will be 
    indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, 
    the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response. 
    Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a 
    server will use it when becoming overloaded. Servers may simply 
    refuse the connection.
